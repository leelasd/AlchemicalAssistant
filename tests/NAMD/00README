## Notes about NAMD tests

- Check if the ICs of the A2B residue is exactly the sums of individual
  ICs of state A and B
- In theory because of the presence of non-interacting initial and 
  final states, when minimized or performed a single point calculation
  energy should be sum of initial and final states

## Notes to Run scripts

```scriptname: gasphase_setup.pgn
topology INI_2_FIN.rtf  
segment COM { residue 1 A2B }
coordpdb INI_2_FIN_NAMD.pdb COM 
writepsf A2B_gas.psf
writepdb A2B_gas.pdb
```

### run the script by using the following command 

$ psfgen gasphase_setup.pgn
$ cp A2B_gas.pdb zero.fep 
- initial and final states are annotated in the B-factor column with 1.0 and -1.0  
$ alchemify A2B_gas.psf zero.psf zero.fep 
$ use zero.psf instead of A2B_gas.psf for minimizing 


For JAKsystem 
- A wild card for missing dihedral angle is because there can be an angle or dihedral possible 
  between two atoms, like in a 5 membered ring. Thats why without this wildcard it gives an error
  Need to worry about this issue in LigParGen :D
